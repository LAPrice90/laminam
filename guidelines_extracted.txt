2025 Guidelines for the correct use of the Laminam brand6
The word that best describes our history is evolution because we have always regarded innovation as a key value in the definition 
of new design visions.
Laminam was founded in the early 2000s, following our founder's invention of a production technology for the creation of large 
ultra-thin ceramic surfaces. As the sector was now mature, the brand decided to trust its intuition and begin marketing innovative 
sizes and thicknesses, revolutionising the ceramic market in the process.
Thanks to major investments in technological innovation and research & development, a continuous constructive dialogue with 
the entire supply chain, and the ability to conquer new markets, Laminam has established itself as an international leader in the 
high-quality Natural Surfaces sector.
Its range of large ceramic surfaces with superior technical and aesthetic performance levels are mainly used in traditional and 
advanced architecture (flooring, wall cladding, facades) and in the design sector (kitchen worktops, tables, furniture and bathrooms).
Eclectic, versatile, distributed in more than 100 countries around the world: Laminam’s creations are constantly being enhanced 
with new colours and finishes to inspire designers, architects, and anyone who wants to give their space a new look and feel.
The R&D department and technology lab work tirelessly on new materials, new body mixes and new technologies to improve 
the efficiency and sustainability of our products, expanding their markets and uses.

Complementary

Each Laminam collection is a unique visual universe 
that includes complementary colours designed to 
strengthen its identity and enhance its expressiveness.
These colour combinations are not just simple 
pairings: they are the result of careful aesthetic 
and design research geared to producing harmonious 
and distinctive solutions.
Each combination is associated with an identification 
number, a sort of creative code that guides the 
detailed colour composition, which can be viewed 
on the following pages.
