Operating from our 75,000 sq ft facility in County Monaghan, we serve architects, developers, and designers across the UK and Ireland with custom-crafted surfaces that unite technical excellence with refined aesthetics. From large-format porcelain wall cladding to tailored furniture and worktops, our work is defined by precision, durability, and material integrity. Every project is a collaboration â€” shaped by vision, delivered with craftsmanship, and built to endure.
